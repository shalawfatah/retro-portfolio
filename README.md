# Portfolio Project
- This is a new portfolio built with GatsbyJS and Supabase. I used framer motions to add some animation. 
- The project is meant to be simple but elegant. I have not used many libraries to build it, just framer motion in a couple of places. 
- I wanted this to be a mixture of 90s and 2020s, where you have a futuristic retro-looking website that performs well.
- I'm not a desiger, but I think the project is built in a way that is pleasing to the eyes in terms of color contrast, white space and overall vibe. 
- Web Vitals scores are high, with performance reaching 98%, Accessibility 97%, Best Practices %100, and SEO 100%.
- I've also updated some projects and removed some old ones here as they were less appealing by today's standards.
- This project is meant to show the consideration to UI/UX and responsive layout.
- Here, you can find some featured projects, blogs, and other information that I've written throughout years.
